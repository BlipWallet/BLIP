# BLIP - Solana Blockchain Wallet

## What is Problem?

### In the Solana ecosystem, wallet experiences are fragmented.

- Wallets are siloed: Phantom, Backpack, Solflare — each separately managed.
- Sending tokens peer-to-peer (P2P) requires manually copying addresses or using QR codes.
- There is no fun, social way to meet nearby traders, share positions, or trade instantly.
- DeFi onboarding for normal users is still complicated.
- Cross-chain asset movement (e.g., SOL → ETH) is complex, requiring multiple apps.

## Solution: Blip Wallet

### "The easiest way to connect, swap, and grow with Solana users around you."

Blip Wallet aggregates multiple Solana wallets into one simple mobile app,

using Bluetooth to instantly discover nearby users,

enabling fast token transfers, social PnL sharing,

**and direct cross-chain swaps powered by Wormhole Intents**.

Even when no users are around, Blip Wallet will show sponsor campaigns (airdrops, DEX promotions) to keep users engaged and rewarded.

## Key Feature

### Cross-Chain Functionality

- BLIP incorporates robust cross-chain capabilities through the Wormhole protocol, enabling users to:
- Seamless Asset Bridging: Transfer assets between Solana and multiple blockchains including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche through an in-app bridge.
- Cross-Chain Transaction Management: Monitor and manage cross-chain transactions with real-time status updates and confirmation notifications.
- Multi-Chain Portfolio View: View aggregated balances and assets across multiple blockchains in a unified interface.
- Optimized Bridge Fees: Automatically calculate and suggest the most cost-effective bridging routes between chains.
- Security Measures: Implement additional verification steps for cross-chain transactions to prevent errors and enhance security.
- Transaction History: Comprehensive history tracking for all cross-chain transfers, including source chain, destination chain, amounts, fees, and timestamps.

### Bluetooth Connectivity

- BLIP leverages the Web Bluetooth API to create a unique peer-to-peer experience:
- Proximity-based User Discovery: Scan for nearby BLIP users using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertising and discovery protocols.
- Secure Pairing Process: Establish secure Bluetooth connections between devices with encryption and authentication protocols to protect user privacy.
- Real-time Presence Detection: Continuously monitor for BLIP users entering and leaving Bluetooth range with customizable scanning intervals.
- Profile Exchange: Automatically exchange wallet addresses and user profiles upon successful Bluetooth pairing.
- Direct P2P Transactions: Initiate and complete transactions directly between two devices in proximity without relying on internet connectivity.
- Bluetooth Signal Strength Indicators: Display relative distance between users based on Bluetooth signal strength (RSSI values).
- Connection Management: Save trusted devices for faster reconnection and enable/disable discovery mode for privacy control.
- Bluetooth Service Characteristics: Implement custom BLE service characteristics for wallet address exchange, transaction signing requests, and notification propagation.
- Cross-platform Compatibility: Ensure compatibility across various device types and operating systems supporting Web Bluetooth API.
- Power Optimization: Implement intelligent scanning patterns to minimize battery consumption while maintaining discovery capabilities.
- BLIP represents the next evolution in blockchain wallets by combining the technical capabilities of Solana's high-speed network with social discovery features, creating a unique blend of financial utility and social connectivity.
